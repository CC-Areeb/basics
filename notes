"Few Routing ways"


We can use prefixes to set the prefix of a route name and group all the routes that 
are starting with the same URL point inside that group as shown below

"
Route::prefix('/test')->group(function() {
    Route::get(/, [TestController::class, 'test_index']);
    Route::get(/blog, [TestController::class, 'test_create']);
    Route::get(/blog/{id}/edit, [TestController::class, 'test_edit']);
});
"

We can also use fallback routes so that when user are trying to access incorrect routes
they will always be redirected to either the home page or the dashboard or the login page
as shown below

"
Route::fallback(FallbackController::class);
"

you can also call in the function inside directly as well as shown below

"
Route::fallback('/login', function(){
    return view(login);
})
"

I chose to use the controller and inside the controller I have an invoke method 
as shown below

"
public function __invoke()
    {
        return view('welcome');
    }
"
The invoke method is a special function inside laravel which is used in single action
controllers.

You can generate an invokable controller by using the --invokable option

"
php artisan make:controller ProvisionServer --invokable
"
